# SAT_Participation

[see code](https://github.com/scottokinawa/SAT_Participation/blob/master/code/SAT%20Participation%20.ipynb)

I want to see how to possibly increase SAT_Participation

I want to quickly note that in this exercise the SAT max score is a 1600 and the ACT max score is a 36. 

I will be diving into the data to see how i could possibly increase SAT participation amongst different states. I will be looking only 
at the test scores and participation rates amonst the states. That means there are plenty of other factors not taken in to consideration,
for instance I heard that the ACT has deals with certain states to offer it to everyone. That means the average score for these states could 
be lowered. 

I hope you find the data I found interesting and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
